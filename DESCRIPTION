Description: The task of finding points closest to a geometry or contained 
    within a geometry from a huge set of points is an important task in many 
    geometry algorithms. 'orion' provides spatial searching for the Euclid 
    ecosystem through a powerful kd tree implementation that supports both
    nearest/furthest neighbor and range queries.
